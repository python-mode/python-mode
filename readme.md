# Python-mode, a Python IDE for Vim

***Important***: From 2017-11-19 onwards python-mode uses submodules instead of
hard coding 3rd party libraries into its codebase. Please issue the command:  
`git submodule update --init --recursive`  
inside your python-mode folder.

If you are a new user please clone the repos using the recursive flag:  
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/python-mode/python-mode`

Python-mode is a Vim plugin that magically converts Vim into a Python IDE.

Why Python-mode?

1.  **Be more productive**: Pymode saves time by bring all tools necessary for
    professional developers so that you can focus on bigger things. It has been
    finely tuned based on decades of experience working with Vim and is
    constantly kept uptodate.
2.  **Get smart assistance**: Pymode knows all about your code. We use the
    best-in-class intellisense code completion, on-the-fly error checking and
    quick-fixes; easy project navigation and much more.
3.  **Use the full power and capabilities of Vim**: Unlike traditional IDEs
    which can only provide a small subset of Vim functionalities, you can do
    everything and anything that you can in Vim.
4.  **Modular structure**: We attempt to be create Python-mode in the same
    principles of python: i.e. have a modular structure, so that as and when
    better libraries evolve, we can provide you the best experience, while
    abstracting the details so that you can get back to what you do best.
5.  **Written mostly in Python**: 96.1% written in Python. Well we love Python
    :)

The plugin contains all you need to develop python applications in Vim.

* Support Python version 2.6+ and 3.2+
* Syntax highlighting
* Virtualenv support
* Run python code (`<leader>r`)
* Add/remove breakpoints (`<leader>b`)
* Improved Python indentation
* Python motions and operators (`]]`, `3[[`, `]]M`, `vaC`, `viM`,
  `daC`, `ciM`, ...)
* Improved Python folding
* Run multiple code checkers simultaneously (`:PymodeLint`)
* Autofix PEP8 errors (`:PymodeLintAuto`)
* Search in python documentation (`<leader>K`)
* Code refactoring
* Intellisense code-completion
* Go to definition (`<C-c>g`)
* And more, more ...

**To read python-mode documentation in Vim, use** `:help pymode`.

# Requirements

Vim >= 7.3 (most features needed +python or +python3 support) (also
`--with-features=big` if you want `g:pymode_lint_signs`).

# How to install

## Manually (according to vim's package structure)

As of vim8 there is an officially supported way of adding plugins. See `:tab
help packages` in vim for details.

    cd ~/.vim/pack/foo/start
    git clone https://github.com/python-mode/python-mode.git
    cd python-mode
    git submodule update --init --recursive


## Using pathogen

    cd ~/.vim
    mkdir -p bundle && cd bundle
    git clone https://github.com/python-mode/python-mode.git

Enable [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) in your `~/.vimrc`:

    " Pathogen load
    filetype off

    call pathogen#infect()
    call pathogen#helptags()

    filetype plugin indent on
    syntax on

## Manually

    % git clone https://github.com/python-mode/python-mode.git
    % cd python-mode
    % cp -R * ~/.vim

Then rebuild **helptags** in vim:

    :helptags ~/.vim/doc/

**filetype-plugin** (`:help filetype-plugin-on`) and **filetype-indent**
(`:help filetype-indent-on`) must be enabled to use python-mode.

# Troubleshooting/Debugging

First read our short
[FAQ](https://github.com/python-mode/python-mode/blob/develop/doc/pymode.txt)
or using `:help pymode-faq`.
If your question is not described there then you already know what to do
(because you read the first item of our FAQ :) ).

Nevertheless just a refresher on how to submit bugs:

**(From the FAQ)** Start python mode with:  
`vim -i NONE -u <path_to_pymode>/debugvimrc.vim`  
Reproduce the error and submit your python mode debug file. You can check its
location with `:messages` for something like:  
`pymode debug msg 1: Starting debug on: 2017-11-18 16:44:13 with file /tmp/pymode_debug_file.txt`.  
Please submit the entire content of the file along with a reasoning of why the
plugin seems broken.

***Do check for sensitive information in the file before submitting.***

# Frequent problems

Read this section before opening an issue on the tracker.

## Python 3 syntax

By default python-mode uses python 2 syntax checking. To enable python 3 syntax
checking (e.g. for async) add:

    let g:pymode_python = 'python3'

To your vimrc or exrc file.

# Documentation

Documentation is available in your vim `:help pymode`.
