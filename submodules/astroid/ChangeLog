===================
astroid's ChangeLog
===================

What's New in astroid 2.0?
==========================

Release Date: Unknown

   * Inference support for `dict.fromkeys`

     Close #110

   * `int()` builtin is inferred as returning integers.

     Close #150

   * `str()` builtin is inferred as returning strings.

     Close #148

   * DescriptorBoundMethod has the correct number of arguments defined.

   * Improvement of the numpy numeric types definition.

     Close PyCQA/pylint#1971

   * Subclasses of *property* are now interpreted as properties

     Close PyCQA/pylint#1601

   * AsStringRegexpPredicate has been removed.

     Use transform predicates instead of it.

   * Switched to using typed_ast for getting access to type comments

     As a side effect of this change, some nodes gained a new `type_annotation` attribute,
     which, if the type comments were correctly parsed, should contain a node object
     with the corresponding objects from the type comment.

   * typing.X[...] and typing.NewType are inferred as classes instead of instances.

   * Module.__path__ is now a list

     It used to be a string containing the path, but it doesn't reflect the situation
     on Python, where it is actually a list.

   * Fix a bug with namespace package's __path__ attribute.

     Close #528

   * Added brain tips for random.sample

     Part of PyCQA/pylint#811

   * Add brain tip for `issubclass` builtin

     Close #101.

   * Fix submodule imports from six

     Close PyCQA/pylint#1640

   * Fix missing __module__ and __qualname__ from class definition locals

     Close #98

   * Stop duplicate nodes with the same key values
     from appearing in dictionaries from dictionary unpacking.

     Close PyCQA/pylint#1843

   * Fix ``contextlib.contextmanager`` inference for nested context managers

What's New in astroid 1.6.0?
============================

Release Date: 2017-12-15


   * When verifying duplicates classes in MRO, ignore on-the-fly generated classes

     Close PyCQA/pylint#1706

   * Add brain tip for attrs library to prevent unsupported-assignment-operation false positives

	 Close PYCQA/pylint#1698

   * file_stream was removed, since it was deprecated for three releases

     Instead one should use the .stream() method.

   * Vast improvements to numpy support

   * Add brain tips for curses

     Close PyCQA/pylint#1703

   * Add brain tips for UUID.int

     Close PyCQA/pylint#961

   * The result of using object.__new__ as class decorator is correctly inferred as instance

     Close #172

   * Enums created with functional syntax are now iterable

   * Enums created with functional syntax are now subscriptable

   * Don't crash when getting the string representation of BadUnaryOperationMessage

     In some cases, when the operand does not have a .name attribute,
     getting the string representation of a BadUnaryOperationMessage leads
     to a crash.

     Close PyCQA/pylint#1563

   * Don't raise DuplicateBaseError when classes at different locations are used

     For instance, one can implement a namedtuple base class, which gets reused
     on a class with the same name later on in the file. Until now, we considered
     these two classes as being the same, because they shared the name, but in fact
     they are different, being created at different locations and through different
     means.

     Close PyCQA/pylint#1458

    * The func form of namedtuples with keywords is now understood

      Close PyCQA/pylint#1530

    * Dunder class at method level is now inferred as the class of the method

      Close PyCQA/pylint#1328

    * Stop most inference tip overwrites from happening by using
		predicates on existing inference_tip transforms.

      Close #472

    * Fix object.__new__(cls) calls in classmethods by using
        a context which has the proper boundnode for the given
        argument

        Close #404

    * Fix Pathlib type inference

        Close PyCQA/pylint#224
        Close PyCQA/pylint#1660



What's New in astroid 1.5.3?
============================

Release Date: 2017-06-03


    * enum34 dependency is forced to be at least version 1.1.3. Fixes spurious
    bug related to enum classes being falsy in boolean context, which caused
    _Inconsistent Hierarchy_ `RuntimeError` in `singledispatch` module.

    See links below for details:
    - http://bugs.python.org/issue26748
    - https://bitbucket.org/ambv/singledispatch/issues/8/inconsistent-hierarchy-with-enum
    - https://bitbucket.org/stoneleaf/enum34/commits/da50803651ab644e6fce66ebc85562f1117c344b

    * Do not raise an exception when uninferable value is unpacked in ``with`` statement.

    * Lock objects from ``threading`` module are now correctly recognised
      as context managers.


What's New in astroid 1.5.2?
============================

Release Date: 2017-04-17


   * Basic support for the class form of typing.NamedTuple

   * mro() can be computed for classes with old style classes in the hierarchy



What's New in astroid 1.5.0?
============================

Release Date: 2017-04-13


    * Arguments node gained a new attribute, ``kwonlyargs_annotations``

      This new attribute holds the annotations for the keyword-only
      arguments.
      
    * `namedtuple` inference now understands `rename` keyword argument

    * Classes can now know their definition-time arguments.

      Classes can support keyword arguments, which are passed when
      a class is constructed using ``__new__``.

    * Add support for inferring typing.NamedTuple.

    * ClassDef now supports __getitem__ inference through the metaclass.

    * getitem() method accepts nodes now, instead of Python objects.

    * Add support for explicit namespace packages, created with pkg_resources.

    * Add brain tips for _io.TextIOWrapper's buffer and raw attributes.

    * Add `returns` into the proper order in FunctionDef._astroid_fields

      The order is important, since it determines the last child,
      which in turn determines the last line number of a scoped node.

    * Add brain tips for functools.lru_cache.

    * New function, astroid.extract_node, exported out from astroid.test_utils.

    * Stop saving assignment locals in ExceptHandlers, when the context is a store.

      This fixes a tripping case, where the RHS of a ExceptHandler can be redefined
      by the LHS, leading to a local save. For instance, ``except KeyError, exceptions.IndexError``
      could result in a local save for IndexError as KeyError, resulting in potential unexpected
      inferences. Since we don't lose a lot, this syntax gets prohibited.

    * Fix a crash which occurred when the class of a namedtuple could not be inferred.

    * Add support for implicit namespace packages (PEP 420)

      This change involves a couple of modifications. First, we're relying on a
      spec finder protocol, inspired by importlib's ModuleSpec, for finding where
      a file or package is, using importlib's PathFinder as well, which enable
      us to discover namespace packages as well.
      This discovery is the center piece of the namespace package support,
      the other part being the construction of a dummy Module node whenever
      a namespace package root directory is requested during astroid's import
      references.

    * Introduce a special attributes model

      Through this model, astroid starts knowing special attributes of certain Python objects,
      such as functions, classes, super objects and so on. This was previously possible before,
      but now the lookup and the attributes themselves are separated into a new module,
      objectmodel.py, which describes, in a more comprehensive way, the data model of each
      object.

    * Exceptions have their own object model

      Some of exceptions's attributes, such as .args and .message,
      can't be inferred correctly since they are descriptors that get
      transformed into the proper objects at runtime. This can cause issues
      with the static analysis, since they are inferred as different than
      what's expected. Now when we're creating instances of exceptions,
      we're inferring a special object that knows how to transform those
      runtime attributes into the proper objects via a custom object model.
      Closes issue #81

    * dict.values, dict.keys and dict.items are properly
      inferred to their corresponding type, which also
      includes the proper containers for Python 3.

    * Fix a crash which occurred when a method had a same name as a builtin object,
      decorated at the same time by that builtin object ( a property for instance)

    * The inference can handle the case where the attribute is accessed through a subclass
      of a base class and the attribute is defined at the base class's level,
      by taking in consideration a redefinition in the subclass.

      This should fix https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/432

    * Calling lambda methods (defined at class level) can be understood.

    * Don't take in consideration invalid assignments, especially when __slots__
      declaration forbids them.
      
      Close issue #332

    * Functional form of enums support accessing values through __call__.

    * Brain tips for the ssl library.

    * decoratornames() does not leak InferenceError anymore.

    * wildcard_imported_names() got replaced by _public_names()

      Our understanding of wildcard imports through __all__ was
      half baked to say at least, since we couldn't account for
      modifications of the list, which results in tons of false positives.
      Instead, we replaced it with _public_names(), a method which returns
      all the names that are publicly available in a module, that is that
      don't start with an underscore, even though this means that there
      is a possibility for other names to be leaked out even though
      they are not present in the __all__ variable.

      The method is private in 1.4.X.

    * unpack_infer raises InferenceError if it can't operate
      with the given sequences of nodes.

    * Support accessing properties with super().

    * Enforce strong updates per frames.

      When looking up a name in a scope, Scope.lookup will return
      only the values which will be reachable after execution, as seen
      in the following code:
      
           a = 1
           a = 2

      In this case it doesn't make sense to return two values, but
      only the last one.

    * Add support for inference on threading.Lock

      As a matter of fact, astroid can infer on threading.RLock,
      threading.Semaphore, but can't do it on threading.Lock (because it comes
      from an extension module).

    * pkg_resources brain tips are a bit more specific,
      by specifying proper returns.

    * The slots() method conflates all the slots from the ancestors
      into a list of current and parent slots.

      We're doing this because this is the right semantics of slots,
      they get inherited, as long as each parent defines a __slots__
      entry.

    * Some nodes got a new attribute, 'ctx', which tells in which context
      the said node was used.

      The possible values for the contexts are `Load` ('a'), `Del`
      ('del a'), `Store` ('a = 4') and the nodes that got the new
      attribute are Starred, Subscript, List and Tuple. Closes issue #267.

    * relative_to_absolute_name or methods calling it will now raise
      TooManyLevelsError when a relative import was trying to
      access something beyond the top-level package.     

    * AstroidBuildingException is now AstroidBuildingError. The first
      name will exist until astroid 2.0.

    * Add two new exceptions, AstroidImportError and AstroidSyntaxError.
      They are subclasses of AstroidBuildingException and are raised when
      a module can't be imported from various reasons.
      Also do_import_module lets the errors to bubble up without converting
      them to InferenceError. This particular conversion happens only
      during the inference.

    * Revert to using printf-style formatting in as_string, in order
      to avoid a potential problem with encodings when using .format.
      Closes issue #273. Patch by notsqrt.

    * assigned_stmts methods have the same signature from now on.
      
      They used to have different signatures and each one made
      assumptions about what could be passed to other implementations,
      leading to various possible crashes when one or more arguments
      weren't given. Closes issue #277.

    * Fix metaclass detection, when multiple keyword arguments
      are used in class definition.

    * Add support for annotated variable assignments (PEP 526)

    * Starred expressions are now inferred correctly for tuple,
      list, set, and dictionary literals.

    * Support for asynchronous comprehensions introduced in Python 3.6.

      Fixes #399. See PEP530 for details.


What's New in astroid 1.4.1?
============================

Release Date: 2015-11-29


    * Add support for handling Uninferable nodes when calling as_string

      Some object, for instance List or Tuple can have, after inference,
      Uninferable as their elements, happening when their components
      weren't couldn't be inferred properly. This means that as_string
      needs to cope with expecting Uninferable nodes part of the other
      nodes coming for a string transformation. The patch adds a visit
      method in AsString and ``accept`` on Yes / Uninferable nodes.
      Closes issue #270.



What's New in astroid 1.4.0?
============================

Release Date: 2015-11-29
 

    * Class.getattr('__mro__') returns the actual MRO. Closes issue #128.

    * The logilab-common dependency is not needed anymore as the needed code
      was integrated into astroid.

    * Generated enum member stubs now support IntEnum and multiple
      base classes.

    * astroid.builder.AstroidBuilder.string_build and
      astroid.builder.AstroidBuilder.file_build are now raising
      AstroidBuildingException when the parsing of the string raises
      a SyntaxError.

    * Add brain tips for multiprocessing.Manager and
      multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.

    * Add some fixes which enhances the Jython support.
      The fix mostly includes updates to modutils, which is
      modified in order to properly lookup paths from live objects,
      which ends in $py.class, not pyc as for Python 2,       
      Closes issue #83.

    * The Generator objects inferred with `infer_call_result`
      from functions have as parent the function from which they
      are returned.

    * Add brain tips for multiprocessing post Python 3.4+,
      where the module level functions are retrieved with getattr
      from a context object, leading to many no-member errors
      in Pylint.

    * Understand partially the 3-argument form of `type`.
      The only change is that astroid understands members
      passed in as dictionaries as the third argument.

    * .slots() will return an empty list for classes with empty slots.
      Previously it returned None, which is the same value for
      classes without slots at all. This was changed in order
      to better reflect what's actually happening.

    * Improve the inference of Getattr nodes when dealing with
      abstract properties from the abc module.

      In astroid.bases.Instance._wrap_attr we had a detection
      code for properties, which basically inferred whatever
      a property returned, passing the results up the stack,
      to the igetattr() method. It handled only the builtin property
      but the new patch also handles a couple of other properties,
      such as abc.abstractproperty.

    * UnboundMethod.getattr calls the getattr of its _proxied object
      and doesn't call super(...) anymore.

      It previously crashed, since the first ancestor in its mro was
      bases.Proxy and bases.Proxy doesn't implement the .getattr method.
      Closes issue #91.

    * Don't hard fail when calling .mro() on a class which has 
      combined both newstyle and old style classes. The class
      in question is actually newstyle (and the __mro__ can be
      retrieved using Python).

      .mro() fallbacks to using .ancestors() in that case.

    * Class.local_attr and Class.local_attr_ancestors uses internally
      a mro lookup, using .mro() method, if they can.

      That means for newstyle classes, when trying to lookup a member
      using one of these functions, the first one according to the
      mro will be returned. This reflects nicely the reality,
      but it can have as a drawback the fact that it is a behaviour
      change (the previous behaviour was incorrect though). Also,
      having bases which can return multiple values when inferred
      will not work with the new approach, because .mro() only
      retrieves the first value inferred from a base.

    * Expose a implicit_metaclass() method in Class. This will return
      a builtins.type instance for newstyle classes. 

    * Add two new exceptions for handling MRO error cases. DuplicateBasesError
      is emitted when duplicate bases are found in a class,
      InconsistentMroError is raised when the method resolution is determined
      to be inconsistent. They share a common class, MroError, which
      is a subclass of ResolveError, meaning that this change is backwards
      compatible.

    * Classes aren't marked as interfaces anymore, in the `type` attribute.

    * Class.has_dynamic_getattr doesn't return True for special methods
      which aren't implemented in pure Python, as it is the case for extension modules.

      Since most likely the methods were coming from a live object, this implies
      that all of them will have __getattr__ and __getattribute__ present and it
      is wrong to consider that those methods were actually implemented.

    * Add basic support for understanding context managers.

      Currently, there's no way to understand whatever __enter__ returns in a
      context manager and what it is binded using the ``as`` keyword. With these changes,
      we can understand ``bar`` in ``with foo() as bar``, which will be the result of __enter__.

    * Add a new type of node, called *inference objects*. Inference objects are similar with
      AST nodes, but they can be obtained only after inference, so they can't be found
      inside the original AST tree. Their purpose is to handle at astroid level
      some operations which can't be handled when using brain transforms.
      For instance, the first object added is FrozenSet, which can be manipulated
      at astroid's level (inferred, itered etc). Code such as this 'frozenset((1,2))'
      will not return an Instance of frozenset, without having access to its
      content, but a new objects.FrozenSet, which can be used just as a nodes.Set.

    * Add a new *inference object* called Super, which also adds support for understanding
      super calls. astroid understands the zero-argument form of super, specific to
      Python 3, where the interpreter fills itself the arguments of the call. Also, we
      are understanding the 2-argument form of super, both for bounded lookups
      (super(X, instance)) as well as for unbounded lookups (super(X, Y)),
      having as well support for validating that the object-or-type is a subtype
      of the first argument. The unbounded form of super (one argument) is not
      understood, since it's useless in practice and should be removed from
      Python's specification. Closes issue #89.

    * Add inference support for getattr builtin. Now getattr builtins are
      properly understood. Closes issue #103.

    * Add inference support for hasattr builtin. Closes issue #102.

    * Add 'assert_equals' method in nose.tools's brain plugin.

    * Don't leak StopIteration when inferring invalid UnaryOps (+[], +None etc.).

    * Improve the inference of UnaryOperands.

      When inferring unary operands, astroid looks up the return value
      of __pos__, __neg__ and __invert__ to determine the inferred value
      of ``~node``, ``+node`` or ``-node``.

    * Improve the inference of six.moves, especially when using `from ... import ...`
      syntax. Also, we added a new fail import hook for six.moves, which fixes the
      import-error false positive from pylint. Closes issue #107.

    * Make the first steps towards detecting type errors for unary and binary
      operations.

      In exceptions, one object was added for holding information about a possible
      UnaryOp TypeError, object called `UnaryOperationError`. Even though the name
      suggests it's an exception, it's actually not one. When inferring UnaryOps,
      we use this special object to mark a possible TypeError,
      object which can be interpreted by pylint in order to emit a new warning.
      We are also exposing a new method for UnaryOps, called `type_errors`,
      which returns a list of UnaryOperationsError.

    * A new method was added to the AST nodes, 'bool_value'. It is used to deduce
      the value of a node when used in a boolean context, which is useful
      for both inference, as well as for data flow analysis, where we are interested
      in what branches will be followed when the program will be executed.
      `bool_value` returns True, False or YES, if the node's boolean value can't
      be deduced. The method is used when inferring the unary operand `not`.
      Thus, `not something` will result in calling `something.bool_value` and
      negating the result, if it is a boolean.

    * Add inference support for boolean operations (`and` and `not`).

    * Add inference support for the builtin `callable`.

    * astroid.inspector was moved to pylint.pyreverse, since
      it is the only known client of this module. No other change
      was made to the exported API.

    * astroid.utils.ASTWalker and astroid.utils.LocalsVisitor
      were moved to pylint.pyreverse.utils.

    * Add inference support for the builtin `bool`.

    * Add `igetattr` method to scoped_nodes.Function.

    * Add support for Python 3.5's MatMul operation: see PEP 465 for more
      details.

    * NotImplemented is detected properly now as being part of the
      builtins module. Previously trying to infer the Name(NotImplemented)
      returned an YES object.

    * Add astroid.helpers, a module of various useful utilities which don't
      belong yet into other components. Added *object_type*, a function
      which can be used to obtain the type of almost any astroid object,
      similar to how the builtin *type* works.

    * Understand the one-argument form of the builtin *type*.

      This uses the recently added *astroid.helpers.object_type* in order to
      retrieve the Python type of the first argument of the call.

    * Add helpers.is_supertype and helpers.is_subtype, two functions for
      checking if an object is a super/sub type of another.

    * Improve the inference of binary arithmetic operations (normal
      and augmented).

    * Add support for retrieving TypeErrors for binary arithmetic operations.

      The change is similar to what was added for UnaryOps: a new method
      called *type_errors* for both AugAssign and BinOp, which can be used
      to retrieve type errors occurred during inference. Also, a new
      exception object was added, BinaryOperationError.

    * Lambdas found at class level, which have a `self` argument, are considered
      BoundMethods when accessing them from instances of their class.

    * Add support for multiplication of tuples and lists with instances
      which provides an __index__ returning-int method.

    * Add support for indexing containers with instances which provides
      an __index__ returning-int method.

    * Star unpacking in assignments returns properly a list,
      not the individual components. Closes issue #138.

    * Add annotation support for function.as_string(). Closes issue #37.

    * Add support for indexing bytes on Python 3.

    * Add support for inferring subscript on instances, which will 
      use __getitem__. Closes issue #124.

    * Add support for pkg_resources.declare_namespaces.

    * Move pyreverse specific modules and functionality back into pyreverse
      (astroid.manager.Project, astroid.manager.Manager.project_from_files).

    * Understand metaclasses added with six.add_metaclass decorator. Closes issue #129.

    * Add a new convenience API, `astroid.parse`, which can be used to retrieve
      an astroid AST from a source code string, similar to how ast.parse can be
      used to obtain a Python AST from a source string. This is the test_utils.build_module
      promoted to a public API.

    * do_import_module passes the proper relative_only flag if the level is higher
      than 1. This has the side effect that using `from .something import something`
      in a non-package will finally result in an import-error on Pylint's side.
      Until now relative_only was ignored, leading to the import of `something`,
      if it was globally available.

    * Add get_wrapping_class API to scoped_nodes, which can be used to
      retrieve the class that wraps a node.

    * Class.getattr looks by default in the implicit and the explicit metaclasses,
      which is `type` on Python 3.

      Closes issue #114.

    * There's a new separate step for transforms.

      Until now, the transforms were applied at the same time the tree was
      being built. This was problematic if the transform functions were
      using inference, since the inference was executed on a partially
      constructed tree, which led to failures when post-building
      information was needed (such as setting the _from_names
      for the From imports).
      Now there's a separate step for transforms, which are applied
      using transform.TransformVisitor.
      There's a couple of other related changes:

          * astroid.parse and AstroidBuilder gained a new parameter
            `apply_transforms`, which is a boolean flag, which will
            control if the transforms are applied. We do this because
            there are uses when the vanilla tree is wanted, without
            any implicit modification.

          * the transforms are also applied for builtin modules,
            as a side effect of the fact that transform visiting
            was moved in AstroidBuilder._post_build from
            AstroidBuilder._data_build.

      Closes issue #116.
    
    * Class._explicit_metaclass is now a public API, in the form of
      Class.declared_metaclass.

      Class.mro remains the de facto method for retrieving the metaclass
      of a class, which will also do an evaluation of what declared_metaclass
      returns.

    * Understand slices of tuples, lists, strings and instances with support
      for slices.

      Closes issue #137.

    * Add proper grammatical names for `infered` and `ass_type` methods,
      namely `inferred` and `assign_type`.

      The old methods will raise PendingDeprecationWarning, being slated
      for removal in astroid 2.0.

    * Add new AST names in order to be similar to the ones
      from the builtin ast module.

      With this change, Getattr becomes Attributes, Backquote becomes
      Repr, Class is ClassDef, Function is FunctionDef,  Discard is Expr,
      CallFunc is Call, From is ImportFrom, AssName is AssignName
      and AssAttr is AssignAttr. The old names are maintained for backwards
      compatibility and they are interchangeable, in the sense that using
      Discard will use Expr under the hood and the implemented visit_discard
      in checkers will be called with Expr nodes instead. The AST does not
      contain the old nodes, only the interoperability between them hides this
      fact. Recommendations to move to the new nodes are emitted accordingly,
      the old names will be removed in astroid 2.0.

    * Add support for understanding class creation using `type.__new__(mcs, name, bases, attrs)``

      Until now, inferring this kind of calls resulted in Instances, not in classes,
      since astroid didn't understand that the presence of the metaclass in the call
      leads to a class creating, not to an instance creation.

    * Understand the `slice` builtin. Closes issue #184.

    * Add brain tips for numpy.core, which should fix Pylint's #453.

    * Add a new node, DictUnpack, which is used to represent the unpacking
      of a dictionary into another dictionary, using PEP 448 specific syntax
      ({1:2, **{2:3})

      This is a different approach than what the builtin ast module does,
      since it just uses None to represent this kind of operation,
      which seems conceptually wrong, due to the fact the AST contains
      non-AST nodes. Closes issue #206.
     



What's New in astroid 1.3.6?
============================

Release Date: 2015-03-14


    * Class.slots raises NotImplementedError for old style classes.
      Closes issue #67.

    * Add a new option to AstroidManager, `optimize_ast`, which
      controls if peephole optimizer should be enabled or not.
      This prevents a regression, where the visit_binop method
      wasn't called anymore with astroid 1.3.5, due to the differences
      in the resulting AST. Closes issue #82.



What's New in astroid 1.3.5?
============================

Release Date: 2015-03-11


    * Add the ability to optimize small ast subtrees,
      with the first use in the optimization of multiple
      BinOp nodes. This removes recursivity in the rebuilder
      when dealing with a lot of small strings joined by the
      addition operator. Closes issue #59.

    * Obtain the methods for the nose brain tip through an
      unittest.TestCase instance. Closes Pylint issue #457.

    * Fix a crash which occurred when a class was the ancestor
      of itself. Closes issue #78.

    * Improve the scope_lookup method for Classes regarding qualified
      objects, with an attribute name exactly as one provided in the
      class itself.

      For example, a class containing an attribute 'first',
      which was also an import and which had, as a base, a qualified name
      or a Gettattr node, in the form 'module.first', then Pylint would
      have inferred the `first` name as the function from the Class,
      not the import. Closes Pylint issue #466.

    * Implement the assigned_stmts operation for Starred nodes,
      which was omitted when support for Python 3 was added in astroid.
      Closes issue #36.
           


What's New in astroid 1.3.4?
============================

Release Date: 2015-01-17


    * Get the first element from the method list when obtaining
      the functions from nose.tools.trivial. Closes Pylint issue #448.


What's New in astroid 1.3.3?
============================

Release Date: 2015-01-16


    * Restore file_stream to a property, but deprecate it in favour of
      the newly added method Module.stream. By using a method instead of a
      property, it will be easier to properly close the file right
      after it is used, which will ensure that no file descriptors are
      leaked. Until now, due to the fact that a module was cached,
      it was not possible to close the file_stream anywhere.
      file_stream will start emitting PendingDeprecationWarnings in
      astroid 1.4, DeprecationWarnings in astroid 1.5 and it will
      be finally removed in astroid 1.6.

    * Add inference tips for 'tuple', 'list', 'dict' and 'set' builtins.

    * Add brain definition for most string and unicode methods

    * Changed the API for Class.slots. It returns None when the class
      doesn't define any slots. Previously, for both the cases where
      the class didn't have slots defined and when it had an empty list
      of slots, Class.slots returned an empty list.

    * Add a new method to Class nodes, 'mro', for obtaining the
      the method resolution order of the class.

    * Add brain tips for six.moves. Closes issue #63.

    * Improve the detection for functions decorated with decorators
      which returns static or class methods.

    * .slots() can contain unicode strings on Python 2.

    * Add inference tips for nose.tools.



What's New in astroid 1.3.2?
============================

Release Date: 2014-11-22


    * Fixed a crash with invalid subscript index.
 
    * Implement proper base class semantics for Python 3, where
      every class derives from object.

    * Allow more fine-grained control over C extension loading
      in the manager.


What's New in astroid 1.3.1?
============================

Release Date: 2014-11-21

   
    * Fixed a crash issue with the pytest brain module.


What's New in astroid 1.3.0?
============================

Release Date: 2014-11-20


    * Fix a maximum recursion error occurred during the inference,
      where statements with the same name weren't filtered properly.
      Closes pylint issue #295.

    * Check that EmptyNode has an underlying object in
      EmptyNode.has_underlying_object.

    * Simplify the understanding of enum members.

    * Fix an infinite loop with decorator call chain inference,
      where the decorator returns itself. Closes issue #50.

    * Various speed improvements. Patch by Alex Munroe.

    * Add pytest brain plugin. Patch by Robbie Coomber.

    * Support for Python versions < 2.7 has been dropped, and the
      source has been made compatible with Python 2 and 3. Running
      2to3 on installation for Python 3 is not needed anymore.

    * astroid now depends on six.

    * modutils._module_file opens __init__.py in binary mode.
      Closes issues #51 and #13.

    * Only C extensions from trusted sources (the standard library)
      are loaded into the examining Python process to build an AST
      from the live module.

    * Path names on case-insensitive filesystems are now properly
      handled. This fixes the stdlib detection code on Windows.

    * Metaclass-generating functions like six.with_metaclass
      are now supported via some explicit detection code.

    * astroid.register_module_extender has been added to generalize
      the support for module extenders as used by many brain plugins.

    * brain plugins can now register hooks to handle failed imports, 
      as done by the gobject-introspection plugin.

    * The modules have been moved to a separate package directory,
      `setup.py develop` now works correctly.



What's New in astroid 1.2.1?
============================

Release Date: 2014-08-24


    * Fix a crash occurred when inferring decorator call chain.
      Closes issue #42.

    * Set the parent of vararg and kwarg nodes when inferring them.
      Closes issue #43.

    * namedtuple inference knows about '_fields' attribute.

    * enum members knows about the methods from the enum class.

    * Name inference will lookup in the parent function
      of the current scope, in case searching in the current scope
      fails.

    * Inference of the functional form of the enums takes into
      consideration the various inputs that enums accepts.

    * The inference engine handles binary operations (add, mul etc.)
      between instances.

    * Fix an infinite loop in the inference, by returning a copy
      of instance attributes, when calling 'instance_attr'.
      Closes issue #34 (patch by Emile Anclin).

    * Don't crash when trying to infer unbound object.__new__ call.
      Closes issue #11.


What's New in astroid 1.2.0?
============================

Release Date: 2014-07-25


    * Function nodes can detect decorator call chain and see if they are
      decorated with builtin descriptors (`classmethod` and `staticmethod`).

    * infer_call_result called on a subtype of the builtin type will now
      return a new `Class` rather than an `Instance`.

    * `Class.metaclass()` now handles module-level __metaclass__ declaration
      on python 2, and no longer looks at the __metaclass__ class attribute on
      python 3.

    * Function nodes can detect if they are decorated with subclasses
      of builtin descriptors when determining their type
      (`classmethod` and `staticmethod`).

    * Add `slots` method to `Class` nodes, for retrieving
      the list of valid slots it defines.

    * Expose function annotation to astroid: `Arguments` node
      exposes 'varargannotation', 'kwargannotation' and 'annotations'
      attributes, while `Function` node has the 'returns' attribute.

    * Backported most of the logilab.common.modutils module there, as
      most things there are for pylint/astroid only and we want to be
      able to fix them without requiring a new logilab.common release

    * Fix names grabbed using wildcard import in "absolute import mode"
      (ie with absolute_import activated from the __future__ or with
      python 3). Fix pylint issue #58.

    * Add support in pylint-brain for understanding enum classes.


What's New in astroid 1.1.1?
============================

Release Date: 2014-04-30

    * `Class.metaclass()` looks in ancestors when the current class
      does not define explicitly a metaclass.

    * Do not cache modules if a module with the same qname is already
      known, and only return cached modules if both name and filepath
      match. Fixes pylint Bitbucket issue #136.


What's New in astroid 1.1.0?
============================

Release Date: 2014-04-18

    * All class nodes are marked as new style classes for Py3k.

    * Add a `metaclass` function to `Class` nodes to
      retrieve their metaclass.

    * Add a new YieldFrom node.

    * Add support for inferring arguments to namedtuple invocations.

    * Make sure that objects returned for namedtuple
      inference have parents.

    * Don't crash when inferring nodes from `with` clauses
      with multiple context managers. Closes #18.

    * Don't crash when a class has some __call__ method that is not
      inferable. Closes #17.

    * Unwrap instances found in `.ancestors()`, by using their _proxied
      class.

      in each of these platform (2.7 tests are all green)




What's New in astroid 1.0.0?
=============================

Release Date: 2013-07-29

    * Fix some omissions in py2stdlib's version of hashlib and
      add a small test for it.

    * Properly recognize methods annotated with abc.abstract{property,method}
      as abstract.

    * Allow transformation functions on any node, providing a
      `register_transform` function on the manager instead of the
     `register_transformer` to make it more flexible wrt node selection

    * Use the new transformation API to provide support for namedtuple
      (actually in pylint-brain, closes #8766)

    * Added the test_utils module for building ASTs and
      extracting deeply nested nodes for easier testing.

    * Add support for py3k's keyword only arguments (PEP 3102)

    * RENAME THE PROJECT to astroid

    * only call transformers if modname specified




What's New in astroid 0.23.0?

    * fixed generator expression scope bug

    * patch transformer to extract correct line information




What's New in astroid 0.16.0?
=============================

Release Date: 2006-04-19

    * fix living object building to consider classes such as property as
      a class instead of a data descriptor

    * fix multiple assignment inference which was discarding some solutions

    * added some line manipulation methods to handle pylint's block messages
      control feature (Node.last_source_line(), None.block_range(lineno)




What's New in astroid 0.15.1?
=============================

Release Date: 2006-03-10

    * fix avoiding to load everything from living objects... Thanks Amaury!

    * fix a possible NameError in Instance.infer_call_result




What's New in astroid 0.15.0?
=============================

Release Date: 2006-03-06

    * fix possible infinite recursion on global statements (close #10342)
      and in various other cases...

    * fix locals/globals interactions when the global statement is used
      (close #10434)

    * multiple inference related bug fixes

    * associate List, Tuple and Dict and Const nodes to their respective
      classes

    * new .ass_type method on assignment related node, returning the
      assignment type node (Assign, For, ListCompFor, GenExprFor,
      TryExcept)

    * more API refactoring... .resolve method has disappeared, now you
      have .ilookup on every nodes and .getattr/.igetattr on node
      supporting the attribute protocol

    * introduced a YES object that may be returned when there is ambiguity
      on an inference path (typically function call when we don't know
      arguments value)

    * builder try to instantiate builtin exceptions subclasses to get their
      instance attribute




What's New in astroid 0.14.0?
=============================

Release Date: 2006-01-10

    * some major inference improvements and refactoring ! The drawback is
      the introduction of some non backward compatible change in the API
      but it's imho much cleaner and powerful now :)

    * new .import_module method on Module node to help in .resolve
      refactoring

    * .instance_attrs has list of assignments to instance attribute
      dictionary as value instead of one

      as_string for each generator expression related nodes

    * specifically catch KeyboardInterrupt to reraise it in some places

    * fix so that module names are always absolute

    * fix .resolve on package where a subpackage is imported in the
      __init__ file

    * fix a bug regarding construction of Function node from living object
      with earlier version of python 2.4

    * fix a NameError on Import and From self_resolve method

    * fix a bug occurring when building an astng from a living object with
      a property

    * lint fixes




What's New in astroid 0.13.1?
=============================

Release Date: 2005-11-07

    * fix bug on building from living module the same object in
      encountered more than once time (e.g. builtins.object) (close #10069)

    * fix bug in Class.ancestors() regarding inner classes (close #10072)

    * fix .self_resolve() on From and Module nodes to handle package
      precedence over module (close #10066)

    * locals dict for package contains __path__ definition (close #10065)

    * astng provide GenExpr and GenExprFor nodes with python >= 2.4
      (close #10063)

    * fix python2.2 compatibility (close #9922)

    * link .__contains__ to .has_key on scoped node to speed up execution

    * remove no more necessary .module_object() method on From and Module
      nodes

    * normalize parser.ParserError to SyntaxError with python 2.2




What's New in astroid 0.13.0?
=============================

Release Date: 2005-10-21

    * .locals  and .globals on scoped node handle now a list of references
       to each assignment statements instead of a single reference to the
       first assignment statement.

    * fix bug with manager.astng_from_module_name when a context file is
      given (notably fix ZODB 3.4 crash with pylint/pyreverse)

    * fix Compare.as_string method

    * fix bug with lambda object missing the "type" attribute

    * some minor refactoring

    * This package has been extracted from the logilab-common package, which
      will be kept for some time for backward compatibility but will no
      longer be maintained (this explains that this package is starting with
      the 0.13 version number, since the fork occurs with the version
      released in logilab-common 0.12).
