Description: rebuild a new abstract syntax tree from Python's ast
 The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
 Python source code for projects such as pyreverse or pylint.
 .
 It rebuilds the tree generated by the _ast module by recursively walking down
 the AST and building an extended ast. The new node
 classes have additional methods and attributes for different usages.
 Furthermore, astroid builds partial trees by inspecting living objects.
